Release Notes for the Mini-NS Flight Software

- Level 1 FSW - 
- This release of the FSW has no interaction; it outputs SOH packets at 1 Hz 
	and performs basic setup when powered-on.

- Level 2 FSW - 
- This release of the FSW greatly extends the level of interaction from Level 1.
	This version accepts a number of the self-terminating commands and outputs
	multiple kinds of packets in the CCSDS format. Those commands are:
	+ MNS_GETSTAT
	+ MNS_READTEMP
	+ MNS_ENABLE_ACT
	+ MNS_DISABLE_ACT
	+ MNS_TRG
	+ MNS_ECAL
	+ MNS_NGATES
	+ MNS_HV
	+ MNS_INT
	The system performs a more robust setup when powered on, including checking 
	for a configuration file. This version has no Data Acquisition and does not 
	have full support for all of the hardware available to the Mini-NS.
